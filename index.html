                    <h2>About</h2>
                    <p>I’m a Mathematics graduate who studied at the University of Sheffield and has 4 years of online tutoring experience with students with all skill levels. I decided to move completely online due to 
                        the pandemic but quickly found out it was much more convenient for my students whilst the lessons were still meaningful and helpful for them, so I decided to continue my tutoring online.
